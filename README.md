## 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard
# Project Overview
This project involves building a weather dashboard that will display current and future weather conditions for multiple cities. You will retrieve weather data from the 5 Day Weather Forecast API and store the data in localStorage for persistence.

# User Story
As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan my trip accordingly.

# Acceptance Criteria
When I search for a city, I am presented with the current and future weather conditions for that city and the city is added to the search history.
When I view current weather conditions for a city, I see the city name, the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.
When I view future weather conditions for a city, I see a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
When I click on a city in the search history, I am again presented with the current and future weather conditions for that city.
